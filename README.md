# dcp-planner

A course schedule planning tool that scrapes Liberty University course data and uses constraint programming to generate optimized class schedules.

## Project Overview

DCP-Planner is designed to:
- Scrape course information from Liberty University's course catalog
- Parse course metadata including prerequisites, credits, and offering information
- Generate viable course schedules using constraint programming
- Support both residential and online prerequisite handling

## Dependencies

- **ortools** (9.15.6755) - Google OR-Tools for constraint programming
- **pandas** (2.2.3) - Data manipulation and analysis
- **beautifulsoup4** (4.13.0) - Web scraping HTML parsing
- **requests** (2.31.0) - HTTP library for fetching web pages
- **selenium** (4.11.2) - Automated browser control and actions  
- **webdriver_manager** (3.8.5) - Helper library for selenium

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Virtual environment (recommended)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd DCP-Planner
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


### Data Collection
Open `Data/DCP Scraping.ipynb` and run the notebook to:
- Scrape course data from Liberty University catalog
- Parse course information including:
  - Course code and title
  - Credit hours
  - Prerequisites (residential and online)
  - Registration restrictions
  - Offering information
- Generate `Course_Data.csv` with complete course data

Next, open `Data/Offerings_Scrape.py` 
- Navigate to registrar and login
- Scrape course offering data 
- Parse course information including:
  - Course code and title
  - Instructor and location
  - Course availability and time
- Generate `Offerings.csv` with complete offering data

## Key Components

### Class.py
Represents a course with:
- Course code, title, and credits
- Residential and online prerequisites
- Enrollment information
- Integration with OR-Tools constraint model

### Schedule_Generator.py
Implements constraint programming solver to:
- Assign courses to time slots
- Ensure prerequisites are satisfied
- Handle any conflict or constraint


### Day_Interval.py
- Used for conflict detection between course schedules

### Node.py & Option.py
- **Node.py**: Graph representation for prerequisite dependencies
- **Option.py**: Stores and represents valid schedule options


## Notes

- I had to do some manual cleaning on the Offerings.csv and don't quite remember what 🙂
- Have not tested data scraping functionality in a while


## Future Enhancements

- Additional student preference option
- More optimizations to improve performance
- Add visualization of generated schedules
- Ability to optimize for a certain value
